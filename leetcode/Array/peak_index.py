"""
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index Math 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index Math 1 where the peak element is 2,
                or index Math 5 where the peak element is 6.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

    key insight here is that because we know consecutive elements will never be equal
    we can check to see whether or not the sequence is increasing left -> right
    if it is then we search to the right because either:
        1. the sequence continues increasing for the length of the array,
            in which case our oob = -inf. -inf creates our peak
            (since the sequence was increasing we know the number to the left of end is smaller than it)
        2. the sequence decreases at some point, creating a peak
